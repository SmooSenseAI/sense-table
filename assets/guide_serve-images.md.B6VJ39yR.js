You can use the built-in api to access images in your laptop. For example:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>http://localhost:8000/api/get-file?path=~/Downloads/file-name.jpg</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="s3-or-similar-cloud-storage" tabindex="-1">S3 or similar cloud storage <a class="header-anchor" href="#s3-or-similar-cloud-storage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;S3 or similar cloud storage&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For exploration and analytics, low-latency random access to images is often more important than high throughput. Amazon S3 is an ideal solution — it’s scalable, cost-effective, and well-suited for storing large image datasets.</p><p>Once images are stored in S3, they are accessible via URIs like:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>s3://sense-table-demo/datasets/COCO2017/images/000000000001.jpg</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In most enterprise environments, S3 buckets are kept private. To support secure access, SenseTable provides a built-in API to generate signed URLs on demand, allowing images to be safely displayed in web browsers without exposing public access. As long as you setup AWS credentials and endpoint in the environment, it should just work out of the box.</p><p>You may also provide your custom-configured <code>s3_client</code> in the Python SDK.</p>',14)]))}const m=a(o,[["render",n]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
