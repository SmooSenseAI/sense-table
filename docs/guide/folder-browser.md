# Folder Browser

Data Catelog is very useful when you want to discover and overview your data, but it is often maintained by SRE team, inflexible to change and difficult to customize.

SenseTable empowers you to directly use File System as a simple catelog. Benefits:

- It is very fast to get started and flexible to make changes.
- Most of LLMs natively know how to access file systems.
- Cost effective. No need to pay for dedicated servers and databases unless it is needed.

## Markdown description of a folder

You can optionally add `readme.md` to a folder and get it displayed when you preview the folder.



::: warning Caveats of case sensitivity
On macOS the file system is case-insensitive, so any upper/lower case of `Readme.md` or `README.MD` would work.

However S3 is case sensitive, so we need to exactly use `readmd.md` as the file name.
