# Why you need a dedicated tool for data exploration?

SenseTable transforms data exploration from a series of tedious chores into a smooth, intuitive workflow.


## Data exploration: the hidden engine of ML


Data exploration is omnipresent in Machine Learning lifecycle --‚Äî a continuous, essential activity that happens at every stage of your ML project.
While often overlooked, it's the foundation that makes everything else possible:

- Data Collection: Quickly validate raw data quality and spot garbage entries.
-	Feature engineering: identify outliers, missing values, correlations and bias.
-	Dataset curation: Navigate subsets to balance classes or prune noisy data.
-	Training & evaluation: Inspect failure patterns and dive into specific examples.
-	Deployment monitoring: Detect real-world data drift and anomalies.

This cycle never truly stops. It‚Äôs not a single kickoff task ‚Äî it‚Äôs the connective tissue of the ML development loop. Without strong exploration capabilities, you‚Äôre left with vague suspicions instead of concrete, testable hypotheses.

### The pain points

Many data analytics tools are user-friendly and productive, but they often lack the flexibility needed for true data exploration. When exploring, you frequently end up writing ad-hoc scripts and performing tedious manual steps.

Exploration is about answering **a constant stream of small evolving questions**. Each script may only take a few minutes to write, but the interruptions pile up. They break your flow state, drain your energy, and slow down the progress.

## How SenseTable helps

SenseTable automates 80% of repetitive exploration work, while making it easy to plug in your own scripts for the rest.

It works directly with popular data formats ‚Äî CSV, Parquet, JSONL, Lance ‚Äî whether they live on your laptop, in S3, or in other cloud storage.

### How it works

SenseTable translates your GUI interactions into SQL queries, executes them with a high-performance query engine, and returns results as interactive visualizations.

```

Throwing raw data directly at an LLM is rarely optimal.
SenseTable gives the LLM accurate, efficient context automatically, and intepret its response into intuitive GUI.
